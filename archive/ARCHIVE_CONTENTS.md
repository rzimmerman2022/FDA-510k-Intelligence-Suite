# Archive Contents

**Created**: 2025-08-10  
**Purpose**: Repository cleanup and standardization  
**Contains**: Files moved during cleanup process to preserve history while maintaining clean main structure

## Archive Categories

### `/experimental/` - Unfinished Features and Development Documentation

#### `implementation-guides/` (Moved from `docs/implementation-guides/`)
Contains development process documentation and implementation notes from the project's development phase. These files document the iterative development process but are not needed for end-users or ongoing maintenance.

**Files Archived**:
- AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Development notes for auto-refresh feature
- AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md - Completion documentation
- CONNECTION_BASED_REFRESH_FIX.md - Connection refresh fix implementation
- CONNECTION_CLEANUP_FIX.md - Cleanup fix implementation notes
- CONTEXT_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.txt - Testing instructions for context features
- IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETED.md - Overall implementation completion status
- IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md - General implementation process guide
- IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md - Verification process documentation
- POWER_QUERY_ARCHIVE_FIX.md - Archive functionality fix notes
- POWER_QUERY_CONNECTION_NAME_FIX.md - Connection name fix documentation
- POWER_QUERY_ENHANCED_DIAGNOSTICS.txt - Diagnostic enhancement notes
- POWER_QUERY_REFRESH_FIX.md - Refresh fix implementation
- POWER_QUERY_REFRESH_FIX_GUIDE.txt - Fix guide for refresh issues
- POWER_QUERY_REFRESH_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.txt - Detailed fix implementation
- PQ_REFRESH_DIAGNOSTIC_INSTRUCTIONS.txt - Diagnostic instructions
- REFRESH_SOLUTION_CONSOLIDATED.md - Consolidated solution documentation
- SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md - Summary of implemented solutions
- SYNCHRONOUS_REFRESH_FIX.md - Synchronous refresh fix implementation

**Reason for Archival**: These are internal development notes that are valuable for understanding the development process but not needed for end-users or ongoing maintenance. They represent the iterative problem-solving process rather than final documentation.

#### `vba-debug/` (Moved from `src/vba/utilities/`)
Contains VBA debug and development utilities that were used during development but are not needed in the production codebase.

**Files Archived**:
- StandaloneDebug.bas - Standalone debugging module
- mod_ColumnDebugger.bas - Column debugging utilities
- mod_Debug.bas - General debugging functions
- mod_DebugColumnTrace.bas - Column tracing for debugging
- mod_DebugTraceHelpers.bas - Debug trace helper functions
- mod_DirectTrace.bas - Direct tracing functionality

**Reason for Archival**: These are development/debugging utilities that may be useful for future troubleshooting but are not needed in the production codebase. They add complexity without providing end-user value.

### `/redundant/` - Duplicate or Superseded Files

#### `excel-versions/` (Moved from `assets/excel-workbooks/`)
Contains older versions of the main Excel workbook that have been superseded by newer versions.

**Files Archived**:
- _FDA510k_AI_Main_Tool_AutoImport_RawData_v1.0_2024 - 042825.xlsm - Original v1.0 (April 28, 2025)
- _FDA510k_AI_Main_Tool_AutoImport_RawData_v1.0_2024 - 042825 (new 1.1 043025).xlsm - Updated v1.1 (April 30, 2025)

**Current Version Kept**: `_FDA510k_AI_Main_Tool_AutoImport_RawData_v2.0_2024 - 042825 (new 043025).xlsm` (v2.0, latest)

**Reason for Archival**: Multiple versions of the same file create confusion and bloat the repository. The v2.0 version is the most recent and should be the primary version used.

### `/deprecated/` - Currently Empty
This directory is reserved for any deprecated functionality or files that are no longer used but might have historical value.

## Impact on Main Repository

### Files Removed from Main Structure
- **24 implementation guide files** - Development process documentation
- **6 VBA debug modules** - Development/debugging utilities  
- **2 older Excel workbook versions** - Superseded by v2.0

### Benefits of Archival
1. **Cleaner Repository Structure**: Main directories now contain only production-ready or user-facing files
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Developers and users see only relevant files
3. **Preserved History**: All files are preserved for future reference if needed
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Less clutter makes navigation and maintenance easier
5. **Professional Appearance**: Repository looks more organized and enterprise-ready

### Recovery Instructions
If any archived files are needed in the future:
1. Navigate to the appropriate archive subdirectory
2. Copy (not move) the file back to its original location or new desired location
3. Update any references or imports as needed
4. Test functionality to ensure compatibility with current codebase
