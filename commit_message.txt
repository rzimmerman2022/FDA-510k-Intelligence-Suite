feat: Add refresh workaround and standalone debug logger

Implements a workaround for the persistent Power Query refresh Error 1004 encountered during VBA execution. The main processing routine (`mod_510k_Processor.ProcessMonthly510k`) now prompts the user via `MsgBox` whether to attempt the programmatic refresh or skip it, allowing the process to continue with manually refreshed data.

Refactors tracing and logging:
- Removes the redundant `DebugTrace` subroutine from `mod_Debug.bas` to consolidate tracing efforts.
- Introduces a new, independent `StandaloneDebug` module (`StandaloneDebug.bas`) for robust logging without dependencies on existing potentially problematic modules. This module writes to a daily timestamped sheet (e.g., `Debug_YYYYMMDD`) and the Immediate Window.

Adds instrumentation to `mod_Format.bas` using the new `StandaloneDebug.DebugLog` calls to help diagnose ongoing issues with column formatting (order, width) and conditional formatting application (Category column).

Updates formatting logic in `mod_Format.bas`:
- Modifies the `desiredOrder` array in `ReorganizeColumns` to include "Contact", "City", and "State" in the specified sequence.
- Adjusts `FormatTableLook` to set specific widths for "Applicant" and "DeviceName" after the initial AutoFit.

Further investigation is needed to resolve the remaining formatting inconsistencies, using the logs generated by `StandaloneDebug`.
