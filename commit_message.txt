feat: Debug Power Query refresh and logging systems

This commit encapsulates a significant debugging session focused on resolving issues with the Power Query refresh process, duplicate column generation, and the VBA logging mechanisms.

**Logging System (`mod_Logger` / `RunLog`):**

*   Identified that `FlushLogBuf` was not called on successful completion (`CleanExit` in `mod_510k_Processor`) or before workbook close (`Workbook_BeforeClose`).
*   Added explicit calls to `FlushLogBuf` in both `mod_510k_Processor` (within `CleanExit` and `ProcessErrorHandler`) and `ThisWorkbook.cls` (within `Workbook_BeforeClose`) to ensure logs are written reliably.
*   Temporarily added and then removed `Debug.Print` statements within `mod_Logger` to diagnose initial failures.

**Power Query Refresh & Duplicate Columns (`mod_DataIO`, `mod_Format`, `mod_510k_Processor`):**

*   Diagnosed errors (424 "Object required", 1004 "Application-defined...") occurring during `RefreshPowerQuery`.
*   Attempted several strategies to prevent duplicate columns and refresh errors:
    *   Deleting the `ListObject` entirely before refresh (`ClearExistingTable` with `.Delete`). Failed with error 424.
    *   Clearing `DataBodyRange` contents (`ClearExistingTableRows` with `.ClearContents`). Failed with error 1004.
    *   Reverting to deleting the `ListObject` and refreshing via `WorkbookConnection`. Failed with error 424.
*   Reverted `RefreshPowerQuery` in `mod_DataIO` to perform a direct refresh without pre-clearing the table, accepting potential duplicate columns.
*   Modified `DeleteDuplicateColumns` in `mod_Format` to use pattern matching (`Like "* [0-9]"`) to remove duplicate columns *after* refresh and processing.
*   Added a robust fallback mechanism in `mod_510k_Processor` to attempt recreating a missing table by refreshing the underlying `WorkbookConnection`.
*   Improved error handling in `mod_510k_Processor` to capture `Err.Number` and `Err.Description` immediately within the error handler.
*   Fixed compile errors related to variable scope (`errDesc`) and incorrect `End If` placement introduced during modifications.

**Tracing System (`mod_DebugTraceHelpers` / `DebugTrace`):**

*   Enabled detailed tracing (`TRACE_ENABLED = True`, `TRACE_LEVEL = lvlDET`) to aid diagnostics.
*   Added temporary `Debug.Print` statements within `TraceEvt` to investigate why the `DebugTrace` sheet was not being populated despite tracing being enabled.

**Current State:**
The `RunLog` system should now be functional. The Power Query refresh process still fails, likely related to the table state or connection handling. Detailed tracing via `mod_DebugTraceHelpers` is enabled but was not producing output, prompting the addition of `Debug.Print` statements within it for further diagnosis (next step is to analyze this output).
