# FDA 510(k) Intelligence Suite - Implementation Verification

## What's Been Implemented

1. **Automatic Monthly Processing**
   - The workbook now automatically checks dates when opened and processes monthly data accordingly
   - Follows the 10th-of-month rule to determine which month to process
   - Avoids duplicate processing by checking if the target month sheet already exists

2. **Synchronous Refresh Fix**
   - Implemented a guaranteed-safe synchronous refresh method
   - Eliminated the race condition between Power Query and Excel's calculation engine
   - Added fallbacks to ensure refresh works in all scenarios

## Verification Steps

To verify this implementation is working properly:

### Date-Based Processing Test

1. **Open the workbook on a date before the 10th of the month**
   - Result: Should check for the month-before-previous sheet
   - If that sheet exists, it should skip processing with a message
   - If that sheet doesn't exist, it should process that month

2. **Open the workbook on a date on/after the 10th of the month**
   - Result: Should check for the previous month sheet
   - If that sheet exists, it should skip processing with a message
   - If that sheet doesn't exist, it should process that month

### Manual Testing Procedure

To explicitly test different scenarios:

1. **Test normal operation**:
   - Open the workbook
   - Observe that it correctly determines which month to process based on current date
   - Verify process completes without errors

2. **Test duplicate prevention**:
   - Open the workbook after a month has already been processed
   - Verify it correctly identifies the existing sheet and skips processing

3. **Test synchronous refresh**:
   - Open workbook when a refresh is needed
   - Verify Power Query refreshes without the "Excel is refreshing some data" error

4. **Test archive creation**:
   - Open workbook when a new month needs to be processed
   - Verify the appropriate month's sheet is created with formatted data

## Expected Behavior By Date Examples

| Today's Date | Expected Behavior |
|--------------|-------------------|
| May 8, 2025  | Check for "Mar-2025" sheet - skip if exists |
| May 10, 2025 | Check for "Apr-2025" sheet - process if missing |
| June 5, 2025 | Check for "Apr-2025" sheet - skip if exists |
| June 10, 2025 | Check for "May-2025" sheet - process if missing |

## Troubleshooting

If issues are encountered:

1. Check the immediate window/debug traces for detailed logging
2. Verify that your Excel version supports the synchronous refresh methods used
3. Ensure that the Power Query connection name matches "Query - pgGet510kData"
4. Review the status bar messages during processing for indication of progress
