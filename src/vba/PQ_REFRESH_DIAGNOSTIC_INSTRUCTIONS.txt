POWER QUERY REFRESH DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
========================================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
The mod_TestRefresh.bas module contains three different diagnostic tests to help
isolate the cause of the "Application-defined or object-defined error" that occurs 
during Power Query refresh when triggered automatically but not when refreshed manually.

TEST PROCEDURES:
---------------

1. BASIC ISOLATED TEST - TestRefreshOnly()
   This is a simple, isolated test that attempts to refresh the connection
   outside of the normal workflow. It helps determine if the VBA refresh 
   command works in the simplest possible context.

2. DETAILED TEST WITH OPTIONS - TestRefreshWithOptions() 
   This provides more diagnostic information in the Immediate Window (Ctrl+G)
   and tests with specific options that can be controlled in the module.

3. COMPREHENSIVE TEST WITH ALL COMBINATIONS - TestAllOptions()
   This runs a systematic test of all four combinations of BackgroundQuery 
   and Calculation Mode settings to identify which configuration works.

HOW TO RUN THE TESTS:
--------------------
1. Open the Excel workbook
2. Press Alt+F11 to open the VBA Editor
3. In Project Explorer, find and open mod_TestRefresh
4. Press Alt+F8 to open the Macro dialog
5. Select one of the three test procedures and click Run

START WITH: TestRefreshOnly

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
----------------
1. Does the test find the connection? It should display a message confirming
   it found a connection with a name like "pgGet510kData" or "Query - pgGet510kData".

2. Does the test succeed or fail with the same "Application-defined or object-defined error"?
   - If it SUCCEEDS: This indicates the problem is related to something in the main workflow,
     not with the refresh mechanism itself.
   - If it FAILS with the SAME error: The problem is fundamental to any VBA-triggered refresh.

NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULTS:
---------------------------
1. If TestRefreshOnly FAILS:
   Run TestAllOptions to try all combinations of settings 
   (Background True/False, Calculation Manual/Automatic)

2. If TestRefreshOnly SUCCEEDS:
   The issue is likely with the workflow context or timing.
   Possible solutions:
   - Add DoEvents before the refresh call
   - Ensure no sheet operations are happening during refresh
   - Check if the error occurs during specific circumstances

ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS:
-------------------
In mod_TestRefresh.bas, you can modify the constants at the top:

Private Const OPT_REFRESH_WITH_BACKGROUND_FALSE As Boolean = True
Private Const OPT_REFRESH_WITH_CALCULATION_MANUAL As Boolean = True

Try changing these to False (one at a time) in TestRefreshWithOptions
to see if a different configuration helps.
