# FDA 510k Power Query Refresh Solution - Consolidated Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the consolidated Power Query refresh solution implemented in `mod_DataIO.bas`. This implementation combines all the improvements from the previous multiple versions into a single, robust solution.

## Problem Recap

The Excel workbook was experiencing an Error 1004 ("Application-defined or object-defined error") when attempting to refresh Power Query data through VBA code. Key observations:

- The error occurred when refreshing within the main `ProcessMonthly510k` workflow 
- Manual refresh via Excel UI worked fine
- Isolated VBA tests outside the main workflow also worked fine
- The issue was context-dependent, failing specifically in the automated workflow

## Solution Approach

The implemented solution uses a timer-based approach that creates a separate execution context for the refresh operation, breaking the chain from the main workflow that was causing Error 1004. This implementation:

1. Uses `Application.OnTime` to schedule the refresh in a new execution context
2. Includes comprehensive diagnostics to track connection and table states
3. Features automatic retry capability for increased reliability 
4. Adds detailed logging throughout the process
5. Enhances connection management with cleanup of duplicate connections

### Key Components

1. **Timer-Based Refresh**:
   ```vb
   ' In RefreshPowerQuery:
   Application.OnTime Now, "'" & ThisWorkbook.Name & "'!mod_DataIO.ExecuteTimerRefresh"
   ```

2. **Comprehensive State Diagnostics**:
   ```vb
   DiagnoseTableState(targetTable, "Input-Check", PROC_NAME)
   DiagnoseConnectionState(wbConn, "Pre-Refresh", PROC_NAME)
   ```

3. **Automatic Retry Logic**:
   ```vb
   If mRefreshAttemptCount < MAX_REFRESH_ATTEMPTS Then
       mRefreshTimer = Now + TimeSerial(0, 0, 2)
       Application.OnTime mRefreshTimer, "'" & ThisWorkbook.Name & "'!mod_DataIO.ExecuteTimerRefresh"
   End If
   ```

4. **Connection State Management**:
   ```vb
   ' Set connection properties for reliable refresh
   wbConn.OLEDBConnection.BackgroundQuery = False
   wbConn.OLEDBConnection.EnableRefresh = True
   ```

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   ```vb
   ' Handle errors with detailed logging and diagnostic information
   LogEvt PROC_NAME, lgERROR, "Error during refresh: " & mRefreshErrorMessage
   mod_DebugTraceHelpers.TraceEvt lvlERROR, PROC_NAME, "Error during refresh", "Error=" & mRefreshErrorMessage
   ```

## Implementation Details

The consolidated implementation features:

1. **Module-Level Variables** for managing the refresh state:
   - `mTargetTableToRefresh` - The table being refreshed
   - `mRefreshTimer` - Timer ID for the refresh operation
   - `mRefreshSuccess` - Result flag
   - `mRefreshAttemptCount` - Retry counter 
   - `mRefreshWaitingForCompletion` - Flag for synchronization

2. **Two Main Functions**:
   - `RefreshPowerQuery` - The public entry point that initiates the timer-based refresh
   - `ExecuteTimerRefresh` - The private function called by the timer in a separate context

3. **Enhanced Diagnostics Functions**:
   - `DiagnoseTableState` - Checks and logs detailed information about a table object
   - `DiagnoseConnectionState` - Checks and logs detailed information about a connection object

4. **Connection Management**:
   - `CleanupDuplicateConnections` - Handles duplicate connections that Excel/PQ might create

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Reliability**: Works consistently regardless of how it's called in the workflow
2. **Robustness**: Retries automatically if first attempt fails
3. **Diagnostics**: Provides comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. **Performance**: Optimal handling of synchronous vs. asynchronous refresh
5. **Maintainability**: Consolidated into a single module with clear structure

## Testing Results

Based on testing, this solution resolves the Error 1004 issue by:

- Breaking the direct execution chain from the main workflow
- Setting proper connection properties before refresh
- Managing the connection state carefully
- Running the operation in a clean execution context
- Using synchronous refresh mode (BackgroundQuery = False)

## Integration

The module is used in the main workflow (`mod_510k_Processor.bas`) via:

```vb
If Not mod_DataIO.RefreshPowerQuery(tblData) Then
    LogEvt "Refresh", lgERROR, "PQ Refresh failed via mod_DataIO. Processing stopped."
    mod_DebugTraceHelpers.TraceEvt lvlERROR, "ProcessMonthly510k", "PQ Refresh Failed - Halting Process"
    ' Handle error...
End If
```

All references to the previous multiple versions have been updated to use this consolidated solution.
