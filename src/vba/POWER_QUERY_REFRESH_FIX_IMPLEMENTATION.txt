# Power Query Refresh Fix Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the implementation of the timer-based Power Query refresh solution to fix the Error 1004 "Application-defined or object-defined error" that occurs during VBA-triggered refreshes.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new module `mod_DataIO_Enhanced.bas` with a timer-based refresh approach
2. Modified `mod_510k_Processor.bas` to use the enhanced refresh method
3. Added diagnostic tests that confirmed BackgroundQuery=False with synchronous processing is the most reliable approach

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add the Enhanced Data I/O Module

Ensure the `mod_DataIO_Enhanced.bas` module is added to your VBA project. This module contains the improved refresh solution that uses a timer-based approach with retry capability.

### Step 2: Update the Main Processor Module

The main processor module `mod_510k_Processor.bas` has been updated to use the enhanced refresh function. The following changes were made:

1. Replaced calls to `mod_DataIO.RefreshPowerQuery` with `mod_DataIO_Enhanced.RefreshPowerQuery`
2. Updated log messages to reflect the use of the enhanced module
3. Made these changes in both the main refresh section and the "skipped run check" section

### Step 3: Verify Dependencies

For the solution to work properly, ensure:

1. The module references at the top of `mod_510k_Processor.bas` include `mod_DataIO_Enhanced`
2. Both `mod_DataIO` and `mod_DataIO_Enhanced` are present in the VBA project
3. Other modules that might depend on refresh functionality are updated if necessary

## How the Solution Works

The enhanced refresh solution works by:

1. Setting `BackgroundQuery = False` to force synchronous execution
2. Using Application.OnTime to schedule the refresh through a timer event
3. This overcomes context-related issues that cause Error 1004
4. Providing retry capability for more robust execution

## Testing the Fix

To test the solution:

1. Open the workbook and let it trigger ProcessMonthly510k
2. When prompted about refreshing FDA data, select "Yes"
3. Observe if the refresh completes without Error 1004
4. Check the RunLog sheet for log entries indicating success

## Fallback Option

If issues persist:

1. Try running the isolated test module `mod_TestRefresh.bas` to verify that BackgroundQuery=False works in isolation
2. Consider checking additional setting combinations using `mod_TestWithContext.bas`

## Summary

This implementation addresses the Error 1004 issue by using a more reliable refresh approach through the mod_DataIO_Enhanced module. The timer-based method successfully circumvents the context limitations that were causing the original error.
