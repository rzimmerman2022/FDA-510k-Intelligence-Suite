## Best Practices for Documentation

1. **Numbered Prefixes**: Use numbered prefixes (01_, 02_, etc.) to maintain logical ordering of documentation.

2. **Dedicated Location**: Keep documentation files in the `docs` subfolder to avoid cluttering the src/vba directory.

3. **Update Connection Constants**: Always update documentation when changing connection names or other implementation-specific constants.

4. **Include Rollback Instructions**: Every implementation should include clear instructions for disabling or rolling back changes.

5. **Address Edge Cases**: Documentation should address known edge cases and how they are handled.

## Moving Existing Documentation

To comply with this organization, the existing documentation files have been moved to this structure:

- `src/vba/AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `src/vba/docs/01_AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `src/vba/SYNCHRONOUS_REFRESH_FIX.md` → `src/vba/docs/02_SYNCHRONOUS_REFRESH_FIX.md`
- `src/vba/IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md` → `src/vba/docs/03_IMPLEMENTATION_VERIFICATION.md`
- `src/vba/AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` → `src/vba/docs/04_AUTO_REFRESH_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`
