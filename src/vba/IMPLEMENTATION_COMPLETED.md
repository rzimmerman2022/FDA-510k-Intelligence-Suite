# FDA 510k Power Query Refresh - Implementation Completed

## Summary

**The Power Query refresh issue has been resolved and implemented.**

The solution has been consolidated from multiple experimental versions into a single robust implementation in `mod_DataIO.bas` that reliably refreshes Power Query data in all execution contexts.

## Files Updated

1. **`mod_DataIO.bas`** - Completely revised with the timer-based refresh solution
2. **`mod_510k_Processor.bas`** - Updated to use the consolidated `mod_DataIO.RefreshPowerQuery` function

## Documentation Created

1. **`REFRESH_SOLUTION_CONSOLIDATED.md`** - Detailed summary of the implemented solution

## Key Features of the Solution

1. **Timer-Based Execution Context** - Uses `Application.OnTime` to create a separate execution context, avoiding the Error 1004
2. **Automatic Retry** - Will attempt refresh up to 2 times if initial attempt fails
3. **Comprehensive Diagnostics** - Extensive logging of table and connection states
4. **Connection Management** - Handles duplicate connections and ensures proper state
5. **Synchronization** - Manages refresh state across execution contexts

## Next Steps

The solution is ready to use immediately. No further changes are required to other modules.

The previous experimental versions (`mod_DataIO_Enhanced.bas`, `mod_DataIO_Enhanced_Extended.bas`, etc.) can be kept for reference or deleted, as all their functionality is now in the main `mod_DataIO.bas` module.

## Testing

To verify the implementation:
1. Open the workbook
2. Run the main `ProcessMonthly510k` workflow
3. Confirm that the refresh operation completes without Error 1004

## Notes

This implementation is based on systematic testing that identified the issue as context-dependent. The timer-based approach creates a fresh execution context specifically for the refresh operation, avoiding the conditions that led to Error 1004.
