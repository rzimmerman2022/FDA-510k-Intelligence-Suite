POWER QUERY REFRESH ISSUE - DIAGNOSTIC & SOLUTION GUIDE
========================================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
This guide addresses the issue where Power Query refresh fails with 
"Application-defined or object-defined error" when triggered automatically 
(e.g., after clicking "Yes" to refresh prompts) but works when refreshed 
manually.

We've provided a comprehensive set of diagnostic tools and potential solutions
to identify and resolve this issue.

DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS INCLUDED:
-------------------------
1. mod_TestRefresh.bas:
   - Tests basic refresh functionality with various settings combinations
   - Helps identify if any specific settings affect refresh success

2. mod_TestWithContext.bas:
   - Tests refresh in different execution contexts
   - Helps pinpoint if the issue is related to how the refresh is triggered

3. mod_RefreshSolutions.bas:
   - Provides five different implementation approaches that address various
     root causes of the refresh failure

STEP-BY-STEP TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW:
-------------------------------------

STEP 1: RUN BASIC DIAGNOSTICS
   a. Press Alt+F8 and run TestRefreshOnly
   b. If it SUCCEEDS: The issue is likely context-dependent
      * Proceed to Step 2
   c. If it FAILS with the same error:
      * Run TestAllOptions to try different settings combinations
      * Note which combinations succeed or fail
      * Skip to Step 3

STEP 2: RUN CONTEXT-DEPENDENT TESTS
   a. Press Alt+F8 and run TestContextDependentRefresh
   b. Follow the prompts to test refresh in different contexts
   c. Record which contexts succeed and which fail:
      * Direct Call
      * Yes/No Dialog Response
      * CommandBar Button
      * Timer Event
   d. This pinpoints whether the issue occurs only in specific execution contexts
   e. Proceed to Step 3

STEP 3: IMPLEMENT THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION

Based on diagnostic results, choose the most appropriate solution:

SCENARIO A: If the YES/NO DIALOG context fails but others succeed
   * This confirms the issue is with the message box response context
   * RECOMMENDED: Solution1_AsyncRefreshViaTimer or Solution4_PromptWithTimerRefresh
   * These break the direct execution chain from MsgBox to refresh

SCENARIO B: If most contexts fail but DIRECT CALL succeeds
   * The issue is likely with Excel's message queue handling
   * RECOMMENDED: Solution2_MessageQueueClearing
   * This ensures message queue is completely processed before refresh

SCENARIO C: If ALL contexts fail with the same error
   * The issue is likely fundamental to the connection configuration
   * RECOMMENDED: Solution3_ForceEnvironmentReset or Solution5_ConnectionStateReset
   * These attempt to reset Excel state and connection properties

SCENARIO D: If TIMER EVENT context fails but others succeed
   * The issue might be related to asynchronous execution
   * RECOMMENDED: Solution4_PromptWithTimerRefresh (with retry)
   * This adds delays and retry logic to handle timing issues

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
----------------------

1. Identify which function in mod_DataIO.RefreshPowerQuery is failing
   (likely the wbConn.Refresh call)

2. Locate the error-prone code in the relevant modules:
   * The current mod_DataIO.RefreshPowerQuery function
   * The workflow that triggers refresh after a Yes/No prompt

3. Replace the problematic code with the corresponding solution from 
   mod_RefreshSolutions.bas. For example:

   BEFORE:
   ```
   If MsgBox("Do you want to refresh data?", vbYesNo) = vbYes Then
       wbConn.Refresh ' <-- This fails in the Yes/No context
   End If
   ```

   AFTER (using Solution 1):
   ```
   If MsgBox("Do you want to refresh data?", vbYesNo) = vbYes Then
       mod_RefreshSolutions.Solution1_AsyncRefreshViaTimer
   End If
   ```

   OR (using Solution 4):
   ```
   mod_RefreshSolutions.Solution4_PromptWithTimerRefresh("Do you want to refresh data?")
   ```

4. Test the implementation to ensure it resolves the issue

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
------------------------

1. Privacy Settings:
   * Check Excel's Query privacy settings (File > Options > Trust Center > 
     Trust Center Settings > Privacy Options)
   * Ensure "Ignore the Privacy Levels..." is checked for better refresh reliability

2. Connection Properties:
   * Verify connection properties in the Workbook Connections dialog
   * Ensure "Enable Refresh" is checked for all connections

3. Antivirus Software:
   * Some antivirus solutions can interfere with Excel's web query capabilities
   * Try temporarily disabling antivirus shields to test if this is affecting you

4. Excel Version:
   * Some versions of Excel have known issues with Power Query refresh
   * Ensure you're running the latest updates

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
-------------------

1. If using Solution1_AsyncRefreshViaTimer:
   * Make sure ThisWorkbook.Name is correctly referenced
   * Verify the module name is correct in the OnTime call

2. If using Solution5_ConnectionStateReset:
   * This depends on the existing CleanupDuplicateConnections function
   * Ensure this function is properly referenced

3. Debugging:
   * All solutions include Debug.Print statements
   * View the output in the Immediate Window (Ctrl+G in VBA Editor)
   * This can provide valuable insight into where failures occur

SUMMARY:
-------
This issue typically stems from Excel's handling of execution contexts and
message queue processing. The most reliable fixes involve:

1. Breaking the direct execution path from UI actions to refresh operations
2. Ensuring the message queue is properly processed before refresh
3. Carefully preparing the Excel environment before refresh
4. Using timer-based delays and asynchronous execution

By following this guide and implementing the appropriate solution based on
your diagnostic results, you should be able to resolve the Power Query
refresh failure issue.
