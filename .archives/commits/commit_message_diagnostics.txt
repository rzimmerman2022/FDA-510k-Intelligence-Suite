feat(diagnostics): add enhanced Power Query diagnostic capabilities

This commit adds comprehensive diagnostic capabilities to the Power Query refresh 
solution, directly addressing the request for detailed connection state tracking and
debugging tools. The enhanced diagnostics will help troubleshoot any future refresh
issues that might arise.

Key additions:

1. Created mod_DataIO_Enhanced_Extended.bas with robust diagnostic functions:
   - DiagnoseConnectionState(): Captures detailed WorkbookConnection properties
   - DiagnoseTableState(): Examines ListObject and QueryTable state
   - Strategic diagnostic checkpoints at critical execution points

2. Added diagnostic monitoring for key properties:
   - WorkbookConnection.Refreshing state
   - OLEDBConnection.MaintainConnection setting
   - BackgroundQuery configuration
   - EnableRefresh status
   - Connection validity checks

3. Created POWER_QUERY_ENHANCED_DIAGNOSTICS.txt documenting:
   - How the diagnostics address the specific requirements
   - Overview of diagnostic features and benefits
   - Usage instructions for implementing the enhanced diagnostics

The diagnostics are designed to provide comprehensive insight into the
state of connection objects throughout the refresh process, with error-resilient
property checking that won't disrupt the main code flow.
